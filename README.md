# Project 3

## Description
Create a MERN-stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand.

## Acceptance Criteria
Your project must fulfill the following requirements:
* Use React for the front end.
* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
* Be deployed using Render (with data).
* Have a polished UI.
* Be responsive.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Include authentication (JWT).
* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).
* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

### CSS Styling
Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:
* Explore the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include styled-componentsLinks to an external site. and EmotionLinks to an external site..
* Try using a component library, such as Semantic UILinks to an external site., Chakra UILinks to an external site., or Ant DesignLinks to an external site..
* Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.
Ultimately, it doesn't matter which of these options you choose—it just needs to look professional and be mobile-friendly.

### Payment Platform
Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

### Bonus
Although this is not a requirement for your project, try to also implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:
* Uses a web manifest.
* Uses a service worker for offline functionality.
* Is installable.
